# Optimal_beanbag_sequence_finder
This is some pretty useless code but still had fun making. This code will find the sequence needed to beat the arcade game Bean Bag Toss https://www.icegame.com/games/bean-bag-toss/ you can find the score needed to beat the high score by as few points so that you can get the bonus tickets as many times as possible.
I must say that I did not create this code. Chat GPT did.
